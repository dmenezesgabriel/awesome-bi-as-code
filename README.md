# Awesome BI-as-Code [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dmenezesgabriel/awesome-bi-as-code)

## Why this is awesome?

A Dashboard is a software asset. It must be tested with the best software engineering practices, be versioned and exist in testing, staging and production environment during its development.

Drag and drop tools were designed with a user interface-first approach to lower the technical entry barrear. However this can lead to higher technical debit and risks the quality of the data product that is being delivered.

Every day more tools are emerging to solve this problems, and they are truly awesome!
